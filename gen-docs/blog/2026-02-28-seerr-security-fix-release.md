We are releasing **Seerr v3.1.0**, a security-focused update that addresses three CVEs, including a high-priority vulnerability affecting instances configured with Plex Media Server. **We strongly recommend upgrading as soon as possible.**

This release also includes a number of bug fixes and marks the end of our post-merger feature freeze. New features will be resuming in future updates.

## Security Vulnerabilities

This release patches three newly identified CVEs. If you are running a Plex-configured instance of Seerr, **one of these vulnerabilities is high priority and poses a significant risk**, please upgrade immediately.

### [CVE-2026-27707](https://github.com/seerr-team/seerr/security/advisories/GHSA-rc4w-7m3r-c2f7) — Unauthenticated Account Registration via Jellyfin Endpoint (High)

On instances configured to use Plex as the media server, an unauthenticated attacker could register an account by abusing the Jellyfin authentication endpoint. This could allow unauthorized users to gain access to your Seerr instance without valid Plex credentials.

### [CVE-2026-27793](https://github.com/seerr-team/seerr/security/advisories/GHSA-f7xw-jcqr-57hp) — Broken Object-Level Authorization in User Profile Endpoint (Medium)

A broken object-level authorization vulnerability in the user profile endpoint could allow an authenticated user to access another user's profile data, including third-party notification credentials such as webhook URLs, Telegram tokens, and similar sensitive configuration.

### [CVE-2026-27792](https://github.com/seerr-team/seerr/security/advisories/GHSA-gx3h-3jg5-q65f) — Missing Authentication on Push Subscription Endpoints (Medium)

The push subscription endpoints lacked proper authentication checks, allowing unauthenticated requests to interact with subscription management functionality.
